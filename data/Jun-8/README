This data was collected at the front of a house, with a maximum range of about 25 meters. The drone was not actually flying, but rather a human carried the drone around manually. Four tests were conducted with the receiving drone moving away from the base station, while four tests were conducted with the receiving drone spinning in place to see how RSSI was impacted by different movement patterns. These can be visualized using visualize.py
